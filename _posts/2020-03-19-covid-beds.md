 Senior Dr Sundarmani Dixit has accused the government of not conducting a screening on any patients suspected with the coronavirus. The 3 cases that he had forwarded to Teku Hospital- all of them were told that they were fine without performing tests. Mr Dixit also says that Nepal has no kits to test the corona virus. That probably could be a primary reason why there are 0 active cases- people have not been tested and hence not reported.
