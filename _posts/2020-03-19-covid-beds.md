It is unbelievable that there are 0 active cases of Covid-19 in Nepal especially when there are [219,000 cases worldwide and 9,000 deaths already](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). When I came to Nepal via TIA airport a few weeks back, no one asked my travel history and no temperature checks of any kind. This was true for several other travelers. 

Name of Hospital | No of Isolation Beds | Contact Number
--- | --- | ---
Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital |11 | TBD

As per [this article](https://www.spotlightnepal.com/2020/03/17/nepal-add-120-icu-beds-1000-beds-isolation-wards-treat-coronavirus-patients/), there is a plan to add the following number of beds:
