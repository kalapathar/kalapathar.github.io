Nepalese government has been very slow in testing for Covid-19. To aid in the effort, some of us have volunteered to design a site and get responses directly from people. That way there will be less risk for doctors/nurses who get exposed to the COVID-19 patients. If you are in Nepal, please fill out this form (regardless if you are experiencing symptoms or not). If you are not experiencing symptoms, your location in the [map](https://coronastatusnp.com/map) will show as "healthy." Likewise the color will be "yellow" or "red" if there are symptoms or if you know you have been tested positive.  The map section that shows people affected based on the postal codes. We plan to use that data to determine which areas are most affected and what extra steps need to be taken.
